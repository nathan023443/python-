# Ask the user to input the current weather. This can be simplified to three categories for ease: "sunny", "rainy", or "cold".
weather= input("what is the current weather? (sunny, rainy, cold) : ")

# Implement the decision structure to advise on what to wear:
# If the weather is "sunny", recommend "wear sunglasses and a hat".
if weather == "sunny":
    print("wear sunglasses and a hat")


# If the weather is "rainy", recommend "carry an umbrella and wear waterproof boots".
elif weather == "rainy":
    print("carry an umbrella and wear waterproof boots")


# If the weather is "cold", recommend "wear a warm coat and gloves".
elif weather == "cold":

# If the input doesn't match any category, inform the user with a message saying the input was not recognized
else:
